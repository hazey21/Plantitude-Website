         </li>
         <li>Inline images both <a href = "../html/pl_jointeam.html">static</a> and <a href = "../html/index.html">clickable</a>

      </ol>

      <h3>2.2.2 CSS3</h3>
      <ol type = "A"> 
         <li>Use CSS3 to format appearance of <a href = "../html/pl_jointeam.html">paragraphs</a>, <a href = "../html/index.html">lists,</a> <a href = "../html/index.html">headers,</a> <a href = "../html/index.html">background image,</a> <a href = "../html/pl_location.html">tables</a> and <a href = "../html/pl_res_takeout.html">forms</a> 
          <p> -In CSS I customized the paragraph at the bottom of the Join the Team page using background-colors, larger text, borders, font-style, and font-color.</p> 
          <p> -Using CSS I enhanced an unordered list to create a navigation menu with margins, paddings, background-colors, postioning, and display to create the finished product.</p>
          <p> -I also used the header to help contain the navigation menu and logo design.</p>
          <p> -On the home page near the bottom I inserted a background image using background-size to control its width and height.</p> 
          <p> -On the location page I developed a table to showcase the opening hours for the restaurant.</p> 
          <p> -On the reserve and takeout tab there is a custom form for customers to fill out when making reservations to the restuarant.</p></li>
         <li>Use CSS3 contextual selectors (<a href = "../html/index.html">e1, e2, e3;</a> <a href = "../html/index.html">e f;</a> <a href = "../html/pl_res_takeout.html"> e > f;</a> <a href = "../html/pl_jointeam.html">e + f</a>) and at least <a href = "../html/pl_res_takeout.html"> two attribute selectors</a> excluding class and id attribute selectors.
            <p>I used three elements in developing the navicon menu for mobile design by selecting them into displaying as a block.</p>
            <p>Two elements (nav ul) were used in creating the navigation menu by having both list style, margins and paddings changed.</p>
            <p>The reservation form used e > f to select direct children for designing the flex layout.</p>
            <p>I used e + e in the join the team section to add adjacent siblings to show opacity throughout all three images.</p>
            <p>The two other attrbitue selectors I used were in the creation of the reservation form for example: placeholders, min and max for date/ time, as well as using type text for customizing the text boxes.</p></li>
         <li>Use CSS3 styles for color (<a href = "../html/pl_wedcat.html">RGBA</a>& <a href = "../html/index.html">HSLA</a>)

            <p>The visited pseudo-class is used on the home page wedding catering section to have the color changed once clicked.</p>
            <p>The active pseudo-class is used on the home page location section to have the link colored black once activated by the user.</p>
            <p>The hover pseudo-class is used on the navigation menu to highlight a different color when users are hovering over the text. </p>
            <p>The focus pseudo-class is used on the reservation form to change the font-size and border when activated.
